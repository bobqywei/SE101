Dynalist, a start-up founded by University of Waterloo students, offers a unique productivity solution that separates itself from the already saturated market. Unlike the conventional options like Docs and MS Word, Dynalist provides both simplicity and a thoroughly structured interface. Dynalist’s hallmark is its fluid synchronization and its hierarchical bullet point interface. The structured UI allows for users to collapse irrelevant parts of the document that would otherwise get in the way and also to highlight the separate portions of the document. Furthermore, Dynalist utilizes a novel sync algorithm that uses the user’s browser to merge document changes, reducing the server’s computational workload. The algorithm also uses location markers to track individual items and bullets, allowing for fluid inserts/deletions amongst multiple collaborators. Overall, the novel algorithm facilitates a user synchronization experience that rivals those of larger companies while the structured interface allows for a unique workflow that is unparalleled in the industry. Dynalist, which is already available as a browser-based or mobile app, will grow at an even faster pace in the future as the team continues to work on additional features and support while continuing to listen and respond to user feedback.
